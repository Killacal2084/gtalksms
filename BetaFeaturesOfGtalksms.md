# You are hiding stuff from me? #

Thats right. Currently the following commands are not displayed by the help messages:

  * sysinfo
  * settings
  * reject
  * ignore

# But why? #

This features have beta status. They could work for you, or not. That depends on various factors. Displaying them in the help would probably spam the issue reports of GTalkSMS, which is what we want to avoid.

# The hidden features #

## Reject or ignore incoming calls ##
You can reject incoming calls with `reject` and ignore them (makes the phone silent) with `ignore`.

## System Command ##

Just give `sysinfo` a try. If you don't know what these numbers mean, google it! ;-)

## GTalkSMS configurable via XMPP ##
Heavy beta feature and currently only read-only. The command is `settings`.
