# Introduction #

Although GTalkSMS does contain 'GTalk' within its name, in order to achieve the best experience an non-GTalk account is preferred.

# Details #

There are plenty of public and free to use XMPP Servers out there. You can look at these sites

  * [XSF Public Servers List](http://xmpp.org/resources/public-services/)
  * [Jabberes.org Public Servers List](http://www.jabberes.org/servers/)

to find a suitable XMPP Server. The MUC component is very important for some features of GTalkSMS. Feel free to report your experience on the [GTalkSMS Users Mailing List.](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/gtalksms-users)

# One suggestion #

Although jabber.org is very popular, it's also an popular choice by some script kiddies as DoS target. An alternative to jabber.org is jabber.ccc.de.
